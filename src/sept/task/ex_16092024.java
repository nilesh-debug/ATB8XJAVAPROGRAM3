        1. Difference between = and == operator

        A. '=' is a assignment operator. = operator in java is used to assign value to a variable.

                Example: int a=10;

        '==' it is a comparison operator. It checks two values are equal or not.

        Example:  a==2

        2. byte b = 10; long l = 10l; → How much Byte will be used.

        A. Byte uses 1 byte. (8bit signed integer)

        Long uses 8 bytes. (64bit signed integer)

        Total=9bytes

        3. Another byte b = 10; byte c = 10;  What is the answer if they perform b+c,

                What is the data type it will give in result.

                A. When we add two byte values java automatically converts the result into int datatype.

        So, the result of b+c will be int.

       4.   short s = 10;

        char c = 'A'; //65

        int ss = s+c;

        System.out.println(ss); */



        short s=10;

        char c='B';//ASCII value of A is 65

        int ss=s+c;

        System.out.println("The value of ss is: "+ss);//Answer is 75

    }
